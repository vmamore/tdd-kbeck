### TDD
- Write new code only if an automated test has failed.
- Eliminate duplication.
- Our design must consist of many highly cohesive, loosely coupled
componentes, just to make testing easy.

#### The TDD Mantra:
- Red: Write a little test that doesn't work and perhaps doesn't even
compile at first.
- Green: Make the test work quickly, commiting whatever sins 
necessary in the process.
- Refactor: Eliminate all of the duplication created in merely 
getting the test to work.


#### Why would a software engineer work in tiny
#### little steps when his or her mind is capable of great soaring 
#### swoops of design? Courage.
